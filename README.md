# House Price Prediction
Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the dynamic real estate landscape of Bengaluru. This project leverages machine learning techniques to construct a robust Bengaluru House Price Prediction model. By analyzing diverse features such as location, square footage, and amenities, the model strives to provide precise predictions, offering stakeholders valuable insights into the ever-evolving property market in Bengaluru.

## Dataset
The project utilized the "Bengaluru House Price Data" available on Kaggle. This comprehensive dataset encompasses various features related to property characteristics, geographical location, size specifications, bathroom count, and additional attributes crucial for predicting house prices in Bengaluru. For access to the dataset and further exploration, you can find it on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data

## Data Cleaning
In the data cleaning phase, the dataset underwent comprehensive refinement, including the removal of less relevant features, addressing null values, adding a new column, and converting the data type of a specific column. These steps were crucial to establishing a solid foundation for subsequent feature engineering and model development.

## Feature Engineering
During the feature engineering phase, the dataset underwent significant enhancements, including the application of dimensionality reduction and the addition of a new feature. Dimensionality reduction streamlined the dataset, while the introduction of the new feature aimed to capture additional insights and enrich the analysis. These thoughtful adjustments contributed to a more powerful dataset, reinforcing the effectiveness of subsequent machine learning models.

## Outlier Removal
Outliers were systematically addressed by enforcing a minimum threshold of 300 square feet per bedroom, eliminating anomalies in property sizes. Additionally, outliers based on price variation, bathroom count, and inconsistencies in property pricing were identified and removed, resulting in a refined dataset for further analysis.

## Machine Learning Models
Various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, were employed to capture diverse aspects of the dataset.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 Score to identify the most effective model for accurate house price prediction. Additionally, K-Fold Cross Validation was employed to measure the accuracy of the Linear Regression model. This comprehensive evaluation approach aimed to identify the most effective model for precise and reliable house price predictions.

## conclusion
In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis and refinement processes, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal, laid a robust foundation for the machine learning models. The diverse set of models, ranging from Linear Regression to ensemble methods, underwent thorough evaluation using various metrics and K-Fold Cross Validation. The selected model, backed by meticulous evaluation, stands poised to offer accurate and reliable predictions, empowering stakeholders with valuable insights into Bengaluru house prices.

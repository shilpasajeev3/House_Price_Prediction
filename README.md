# House Price Prediction
Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the dynamic real estate landscape of Bengaluru. This project leverages machine learning techniques to construct a robust Bengaluru House Price Prediction model. By analyzing diverse features such as location, square footage, and amenities, the model strives to provide precise predictions, offering stakeholders valuable insights into the ever-evolving property market in Bengaluru.

## Data Cleaning
In the data cleaning phase, several key steps were undertaken to enhance the dataset's quality and relevance:

• Dropping Less Relevant Features: Non-contributory features were dropped from the dataset to streamline and focus the analysis.

• Handling Null Values: Null values were addressed by employing appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal, ensuring data completeness.

• Adding a New Column: To capture additional insights, a new column was added, incorporating relevant information for more comprehensive analysis.

• DataType Conversion: The data type of a specific column was converted, ensuring compatibility with the chosen analysis and model.

By executing these steps, the data cleaning process not only refined the dataset but also laid the groundwork for subsequent feature engineering and model development.
